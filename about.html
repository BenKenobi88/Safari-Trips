                    <p>Our success is built on our passion for safaris and the technology that connects us with you. 
                        Our expertise is based on firsthand travel in every destination that we recommend and because we are 100% 
                        independent, we only work with the best, tried-and-tested suppliers. We don't call our consultants
                        Experts lightly - they earn this title through regular travel, intensive training and written examinations.</p>
                       <p class="dark">If you want to get to know us, talk to us. Don’t be shy if you’re a long way off from making a 
                           booking – we want to hear what excites you about going on safari. Being good listeners is at the heart 
                           of our old school approach to service: if we take the time to get to know you, we can tailor-make your 
                           vacation, filling it with extraordinary experiences and personal touches. That’s when we become your travel 
                           partner, the co-creators of a journey as individual as you are.</p>
